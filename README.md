# Summaryapp (tentative)

A personal project for summarizing local news due to the lack of actual content, and the interest of having users read through lot of Ads means longer articles without relevant information. So I thought on scrapping all data and summarizing it with a NLP model for summarization, and also filtering articles with a Sentiment analysis model to remove the bad news (murder, crime, etc), and also rank news on importance.

So then I'm planning on wrapping all of this in an email with all latest news in something like WSJ email format.
